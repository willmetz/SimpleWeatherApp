# SimpleWeatherApp
A simple weather app to demo custom views and other useful things

Note to use this application you will need an API key from:
http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/ 

After you have the API key you will need to create a file named APIKeyDontCommit.java with the following contents:

package com.example.willmetz.simpleweatherapp;


public class APIKeyDontCommit
{
    public static final String API_KEY = “YOUR API KEY HERE”;
}


Place the API key you created from weather underground in the above string.
